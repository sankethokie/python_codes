"""
The code defines several functions to perform operations on the graph, such as creating a distance matrix (create_D_matrix), calculating transmission numbers vectors (get_out_transmission_numbers_vector and get_in_transmission_numbers_vector), finding specific nodes (get_V_mho, get_vj, and get_V_s), and identifying a fault edge (get_fault_edge).

The create_D_matrix function calculates the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in the graph G and stores them in a matrix D.

The F function appears to be a placeholder for some function F(x, y) that takes two arguments and returns their product.

get_out_transmission_numbers_vector and get_in_transmission_numbers_vector compute vectors h representing the outgoing and incoming transmission numbers from each node in the graph, respectively.

get_V_mho identifies the node(s) with the maximum change in the outgoing transmission numbers (delta_h_out).

get_vj finds a specific node vj based on certain conditions.

get_V_s identifies a set of nodes V_s based on their distances from vj and V_mho.

get_fault_edge is the main function that detects a fault edge between two graphs G and G1 by comparing their transmission numbers vectors and identifying the edge that contributes most to the discrepancy.

In the main part of the code, two graphs G and G1 are created from numpy matrices A and A1, respectively, using the nx.from_numpy_matrix function.

A list weights_of_vertices is defined to assign weights to each node.

The get_fault_edge function is called with G, G1, and weights_of_vertices as arguments, and it returns the fault edge.

Finally, the fault edge is printed.

So, this code is performing fault detection in a network by comparing transmission numbers between two versions of the network represented as graphs. It identifies the edge where the largest discrepancy in transmission numbers occurs, indicating a potential fault.
